**Detailed Description**

In this Python project, I developed a web scraper to automate the downloading and renaming of files from the A to Z Databases website. The project utilized Selenium for browser automation, Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML content, and Requests for handling HTTP requests.

Steps Involved:

**1- Setting Up Selenium:**
- The script initiated a Selenium WebDriver instance to control a web browser for navigating the A to Z Databases website.
- Specific elements on the webpage, such as state selection buttons and search criteria checkboxes, were located using XPaths and interacted with using Selenium commands.

**2- Navigating the Website:**
- The script selected Ohio as the state and specified search criteria such as "Head of Household" and "Homeowner" using Selenium's click() and send_keys() methods.
- Area codes were read from a text file and input into the appropriate search field on the website.

**3- Handling Web Page Navigation:**
- The script managed pagination to navigate through multiple pages of search results. It used WebDriverWait to ensure elements were clickable and handled overlays that might appear during page transitions.

**4- Downloading Files:**
- For each page of search results, the script selected all rows, initiated the download process, and named the files based on the current page number.
- The files were downloaded to a specified directory and renamed using a consistent naming convention.

**5- Function Definitions:**
- select_1000_rows(): Navigated through multiple pages of results, selecting all rows on each page.
- download_selected_rows(): Initiated the download process, setting the file name and confirming the download.
- click_element_with_retry(): Clicked elements with retry logic to handle potential issues like intercepted clicks or stale references.
- revise_search_and_initiate_new_search(): Revised the search criteria and initiated a new search for the next batch of results.

**6- Main Execution Loop:**
The script executed a loop to handle multiple sets of 1000 rows each. It selected rows, downloaded the files, and revised the search criteria for the next batch, ensuring efficient and complete data retrieval.
The automated web scraper significantly reduced manual effort by handling the repetitive tasks of navigating the website, selecting criteria, downloading files, and renaming them systematically. This project demonstrated the effective use of Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Requests in creating robust web scraping solutions.
